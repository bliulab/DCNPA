# KGIPA

<div align="center">

</div>

Understanding peptide-protein interactions is vital for decoding cellular signaling and developing targeted therapies. However, the complexity of multi-molecular associations and diverse non-covalent interactions make accurate prediction and site-specific annotation challenging. Here, we propose **KGIPA, a knowledge-guided pragmatic analysis framework that incorporates pragmatic concepts from natural language into life science**, capturing the influence of biological environments on non-covalent interactions. KGIPA integrates intra- and extra-linguistic contextual information to combine multimodal single-molecule features and build residue-level interaction maps. It also uses biological prior knowledge to coordinate various non-covalent interaction types. Benchmark tests demonstrate KGIPA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in evaluating molecular binding, including protein and peptide binding residues and residue-pair interactions. Furthermore, KGIPA demonstrates strong performance in peptide-protein binding affinity prediction and peptide virtual screening. Wet-lab experiments validate its reliability, revealing high consistency between predicted and experimentally measured binding behaviors. **These results highlight KGIPA’s potential to accelerate peptide drug discovery and establish pragmatic analysis as an effective paradigm for decoding the molecular language of interactions.**

**Given the complexity and potential instability of individual environment configurations, we strongly recommend using the upgraded online prediction server of KGIPA, available at **http://bliulab.net/KGIPA**.

```
SCRATCH-1D 1.2
IUPred2A \
ncbi-blast 2.13.0
ProtT5 \
trRosetta \
```

Databases and model:
```

```

**The default paths to all tools and databases are shown in `conf.py`. You can change the paths to the tools and databases as needed by configuring `conf.py`.**

`SCRATCH-1D`, `IUPred2A`, `ncbi-blast`, `ProtT5`, and `trRosetta` are recommended to be configured as the system envirenment path. Your can follow these steps to install them:

### 1.3.1 How to install SCRATCH-1D
Download (For linux, about 6.3GB. More information, please see **https://download.igb.uci.edu/**)
```
wget https://download.igb.uci.edu/SCRATCH-1D_1.2.tar.gz
tar -xvzf SCRATCH-1D_1.2.tar.gz
```

Install
```
cd SCRATCH-1D_1.2
perl install.pl
```

> **Note:** The 32 bit linux version of blast is provided by default in the 'pkg' sub-folder of the package but can, probably should, and in some cases has to be replaced by the 64 bit or Mac OS version of the blast software for improved performances and compatibility on such systems.


Finally, test the installation of SCRATCH-1D
```
cd <INSTALL_DIR>/doc
../bin/run_SCRATCH-1D_predictors.sh test.fasta test.out 4
```

> **Note:** If your computer has less than 4 cores, replace 4 by 1 in the command line above.

**In addition, users need to move the `SCRATCH.sh` script in `/tools/SCRATCH-1D_1.2/` to the `bin/` directory under the SCRATCH-1D_1.2 installation path for KGIPA to call.**

### 1.3.2 How to install IUPred2A
For download and installation of IUPred2A, please refer to **https://iupred2a.elte.hu/download_new**. It should be noted that this automation service is **only applicable to academic users.** For business users, please contact the original authors for authorization. 

After obtaining the IUPred2A software package, decompress it.
```
tar -xvzf iupred2a.tar.gz
```

Finally, test the installation of IUPred2A
```
cd <INSTALL_DIR>
python3 iupred2a.py P53_HUMAN.seq long
```

**In addition, users need to move the `iupred2a.sh` script in `/tools/iupred2a/` to the IUPred2A installation path for KGIPA to call. Please also make sure to modify the path to the Python script (`iupred2a.py`) within the `iupred2a.sh` file to reflect the absolute path of your IUPred2A installation. This is necessary for the script to function correctly.**

### 1.3.3 How to install ncbi-blast
Download (For x64-linux, about 220M. More information, please see **https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/doc/blast-help/downloadblastdata.html**)
```
wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/2.13.0/ncbi-blast-2.13.0+-x64-linux.tar.gz
tar -xvzf ncbi-blast-2.13.0+-x64-linux.tar.gz
```
Add the path to system envirenment in `~/.bashrc`.
```
export BLAST_HOME={your_path}/ncbi-blast-2.13.0+
export PATH=$PATH:$BLAST_HOME/bin
```

Finally, reload the system envirenment and check the ncbi-blast command:
```
source ~/.bashrc
psiblast -h
```

> **Note:** The purpose of KGIPA with the help of ncbi-blast is to extract the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM). It should be noted that for sequences that cannot be effectively aligned, the PSSM is further extracted by blosum62 (which can be found in [`blosum62.txt`](http://bliulab.net/KGIPA/static/download/blosum62.txt)).


### 1.3.4 How to install ProtT5 (ProtT5-XL-UniRef50)
Download and install (More information, please see **https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans** or **https://zenodo.org/record/4644188**, about 5.3GB)

```
wget https://zenodo.org/records/4644188/files/prot_t5_xl_uniref50.zip?download=1
unzip prot_t5_xl_uniref50.zip
```


### 1.3.5 How to install trRosetta
Download `trRosettaX.tar.bz2` from **https://yanglab.qd.sdu.edu.cn/trRosetta/download/** (about 94MB)

```
tar -xvjf trRosettaX.tar.bz2
cd trRosettaX/
```

Then, refer to the README file to install and configure it. **In addition, users need to move the `generate_msa.sh` and `predict.sh` scripts in `/tools/trRosettaX/` to the trRosettaX installation path for KGIPA to call.**
Please also ensure the following modifications are made for proper execution:

**1) Conda Environment:**
Both `generate_msa.sh` and `predict.sh` need to run under the Conda environment required by trRosettaX.
This can be achieved by modifying the `export PATH=...` line in each script to point to the bin directory of the corresponding Conda environment.

**2) Database Path Configuration:**

In `generate_msa.sh`, set the `-hhdb` parameter to the absolute path of the uniclust30_2018_08 database.

In `predict.sh`, set the `-mdir` parameter to the absolute path of the model_res2net_202108 model directory.

These changes are necessary to ensure KGIPA can correctly invoke trRosetta for structure prediction.


## 1.4 Install KGIPA
To install from the development branch run
```
git clone git@github.com:ShutaoChen97/KGIPA.git
cd KGIPA/
```

**Finally, configure the defalut path of the above tool and the database in `conf.py`. You can change the path of the tool and database by configuring `conf.py` as needed.**


# 2 Usage
It takes 2 steps to predict peptide-protein binary interaction and peptide-protein-specific binding residues:

(1) Replace the default peptide sequence in the `example/Peptide_Seq.fasta` file with your peptide sequence (FASTA format). Similarly, replace the default protein sequence in the `example/Protein_Seq.fasta` file with your protein sequence (FASTA format). If you don't want to do this, you can also test your own peptide-protein pairs by modifying the paths to the files passed in by the `run_predictor.py` script (the parameter is `-uip`, respectively).

(2) Then, run `run_predictor.py` to make prediction, including **pairwise non-covalent interaction** prediction and **non-covalent bond type** identification. It should be noted that `run_predictor.py` automatically calls the scripts `FeatureExtract.py`, and `PSSMExtract.py` to generate the multi-source isomerization features of peptides and proteins.
```
conda activate kgipa
python run_predictor.py -uip example
```

If you want to retrain based on your private dataset, find the original KGIPA model in `model.py`. The KGIPA source code we wrote is based on the Pytorch implementation and can be easily imported by instantiating it.
